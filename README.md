👉 See our [documentation](https://originhub.tech/#/docs) for more about MyScale’s unique features and advantages. Our [open-source benchmark](https://myscale.github.io/benchmark/) provides a detailed comparison with other vector database products.

## ❓ Why build on ClickHouse?

[ClickHouse](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse) is a popular open-source analytical database that excels at big data processing and analytics due to its columnar storage with advanced compression, skip indexing, and SIMD processing. Unlike transactional databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL, which use row storage and main optimizers for transactional processing, ClickHouse has significantly faster analytical and data scanning speeds.

🚀 One of the key operations in combining structured and vector search is filtered search, which involves filtering by other attributes first and then performing vector search on the remaining data. [Columnar storage and pre-filtering are crucial](https://myscale.com/blog/filtered-vector-search-in-myscale/#behind-the-scene) for ensuring high accuracy and high performance in filtered search, which is why we chose to build MyScaleDB on top of ClickHouse.

💡 We've contributed many enhancements related to general SQL processing back to ClickHouse to ensure fast and cost-effective SQL vector queries：

## 🖥️ Self-Hosted

### Using MyScaleDB Docker Image

To quickly get a MyScaleDB instance up and running, get the docker image:

```bash
wget  https://originhub-public.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/image/myscaledb-amd64-v2-0-0.tar

cat ./myscaledb-amd64-v2-0-0.tar | docker import - myscaledb-v2.0.0
```

```bash
docker run -v /etc/clickhouse/data:/container/data --name myscaledb --net=host myscaledb-v2.0.0
```

>Note: Myscale's default configuration only allows localhost ip access. For the docker run startup method, you need to specify `--net=host` to access services deployed in docker mode on the current node.

This will start a MyScaleDB instance with default user `default` and no password. You can then connect to the database using `clickhouse-client`:

```bash
docker exec -it myscaledb clickhouse-client
```

### Using Docker Compose

1. Use the following recommended directory structure and the location of the `docker-compose.yaml` file:

```bash
> tree myscaledb
myscaledb
├── docker-compose.yaml
└── volumes
    └── config
        └── users.d
            └── custom_users_config.xml

3 directories, 2 files
```

2. Define the configuration for your deployment. We recommend starting with the following configuration in your `docker-compose.yaml` file, which you can adjust based on your specific requirements:

```yaml
version: '3.7'

services:
  myscaledb:
    image: myscale/myscaledb:2.0.0
    tty: true
    ports:
      - '8123:8123'
      - '9000:9000'
      - '8998:8998'
      - '9363:9363'
      - '9116:9116'
    networks:
      myscaledb_network:
        ipv4_address: 10.0.0.2
    volumes:
      - ${DOCKER_VOLUME_DIRECTORY:-.}/volumes/data:/var/lib/clickhouse
      - ${DOCKER_VOLUME_DIRECTORY:-.}/volumes/log:/var/log/clickhouse-server
      - ${DOCKER_VOLUME_DIRECTORY:-.}/volumes/config/users.d/custom_users_config.xml:/etc/clickhouse-server/users.d/custom_users_config.xml
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: "16.00"
          memory: 32Gb
networks:
  myscaledb_network:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      driver: default
      config:
        - subnet: 10.0.0.0/24
```

`custom_users_config.xml`:

```xml
<clickhouse>
  <users>
      <default>
          <password></password>
          <networks>
              <ip>::1</ip>
              <ip>127.0.0.1</ip>
              <ip>10.0.0.0/24</ip>
          </networks>
          <profile>default</profile>
          <quota>default</quota>
          <access_management>1</access_management>
      </default>
  </users>
</clickhouse>
```

> Note: The custom_users_config configuration allows you to use the default user to access the database on the node where the database service is deployed using docker compose. If you want to access the database service on other nodes, it is recommended to create a user that can be accessed through other IPs. For detailed settings, see: [MyScaleDB Create User](https://myscale.com/docs/en/sql-reference/create-queries/#create-user).

> You can also customize the configuration file of MyScaleDB. Copy the `/etc/clickhouse-server` directory from your `myscaledb` container to your local drive, modify the configuration, and add a directory mapping to the `docker-compose.yaml` file to make the configuration take effect:
>
> ```yaml
> - ${DOCKER_VOLUME_DIRECTORY:-.}/volumes/config:/etc/clickhouse-server
> ```

3. Use the following command to get it running:

```bash
cd myscaledb
docker compose up -d
```

4. Access the MyScaleDB command line interface using the following command.

```bash
docker exec -it myscaledb-myscaledb-1 clickhouse-client
```

5. You can now run SQL statements. See [Executing SQL Queries](https://myscale.com/docs/en/quickstart/#executing-sql-queries).

## 📚 Tutorial

See [Vector Search Documentation](https://myscale.com/docs/en/vector-search/) for how to create a SQL table with vector index and perform vector search. It's recommended to specify `TYPE SCANN` when creating a vector index in open source MyScaleDB.

### 1️⃣ Create a Table with Vector Column

```sql
-- Create a table with body_vector of length 384
CREATE TABLE default.wiki_abstract
(
    `id` UInt64,
    `body` String,
    `title` String,
    `url` String,
    `body_vector` Array(Float32),
    CONSTRAINT check_length CHECK length(body_vector) = 384
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY id;
```

### 2️⃣ Insert Data to Your Table

```sql
-- Insert data from parquet files on S3
INSERT INTO default.wiki_abstract SELECT * FROM s3('https://myscale-datasets.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wiki_abstract_with_vector.parquet','Parquet');
```

### 3️⃣ Create the Vector Index

```sql
-- Build a SCANN vector index with Cosine metric on the body_vector
ALTER TABLE default.wiki_abstract ADD VECTOR INDEX vec_idx body_vector TYPE SCANN('metric_type=Cosine');

-- Query the index build progress from the `vector_indices` table
-- Wait until the index progress becomes `Built`
SELECT * FROM system.vector_indices;
```

### 4️⃣ Execute Vector Search

```sql
-- Perform vector search return the top-5 results
SELECT
  id,
  title,
  distance(body_vector, [-0.052, -0.0146, -0.0677, -0.0256, -0.0395, -0.0381, -0.025, 0.0911, -0.0429, -0.0592, 0.0017, -0.0358, -0.0464, -0.0189, -0.0192, 0.0544, -0.0022, -0.0292, -0.0474, -0.0286, 0.0746, -0.013, -0.0217, -0.0246, -0.0169, 0.0495, -0.0947, 0.0139, 0.0445, -0.0262, -0.0049, 0.0506, 0.004, 0.0276, 0.0063, -0.0643, 0.0059, -0.0229, -0.0315, 0.0549, 0.1427, 0.0079, 0.011, -0.0036, -0.0617, 0.0155, -0.0607, 0.0258, -0.0205, 0.0008, -0.0547, 0.0329, -0.0522, -0.0347, 0.0921, 0.0139, -0.013, 0.0716, -0.0165, 0.0257, -0.0071, 0.0084, -0.0653, 0.0091, 0.0544, -0.0192, -0.0169, -0.0017, -0.0304, 0.0427, -0.0389, 0.0921, -0.0622, -0.0196, 0.0025, 0.0214, 0.0259, -0.0493, -0.0211, -0.119, -0.0736, -0.1545, -0.0578, -0.0145, 0.0138, 0.0478, -0.0451, -0.0332, 0.0799, 0.0001, -0.0737, 0.0427, 0.0517, 0.0102, 0.0386, 0.0233, 0.0425, -0.0279, -0.0529, 0.0744, -0.0305, -0.026, 0.1229, -0.002, 0.0038, -0.0491, 0.0352, 0.0027, -0.056, -0.1044, 0.123, -0.0184, 0.1148, -0.0189, 0.0412, -0.0347, -0.0569, -0.0119, 0.0098, -0.0016, 0.0451, 0.0273, 0.0436, 0.0082, 0.0166, -0.0989, 0.0747, -0.0, 0.0306, -0.0717, -0.007, 0.0665, 0.0452, 0.0123, -0.0238, 0.0512, -0.0116, 0.0517, 0.0288, -0.0013, 0.0176, 0.0762, 0.1284, -0.031, 0.0891, -0.0286, 0.0132, 0.003, 0.0433, 0.0102, -0.0209, -0.0459, -0.0312, -0.0387, 0.0201, -0.027, 0.0243, 0.0713, 0.0359, -0.0674, -0.0747, -0.0147, 0.0489, -0.0092, -0.018, 0.0236, 0.0372, -0.0071, -0.0513, -0.0396, -0.0316, -0.0297, -0.0385, -0.062, 0.0465, 0.0539, -0.033, 0.0643, 0.061, 0.0062, 0.0245, 0.0868, 0.0523, -0.0253, 0.0157, 0.0266, 0.0124, 0.1382, -0.0107, 0.0835, -0.1057, -0.0188, -0.0786, 0.057, 0.0707, -0.0185, 0.0708, 0.0189, -0.0374, -0.0484, 0.0089, 0.0247, 0.0255, -0.0118, 0.0739, 0.0114, -0.0448, -0.016, -0.0836, 0.0107, 0.0067, -0.0535, -0.0186, -0.0042, 0.0582, -0.0731, -0.0593, 0.0299, 0.0004, -0.0299, 0.0128, -0.0549, 0.0493, 0.0, -0.0419, 0.0549, -0.0315, 0.1012, 0.0459, -0.0628, 0.0417, -0.0153, 0.0471, -0.0301, -0.0615, 0.0137, -0.0219, 0.0735, 0.083, 0.0114, -0.0326, -0.0272, 0.0642, -0.0203, 0.0557, -0.0579, 0.0883, 0.0719, 0.0007, 0.0598, -0.0431, -0.0189, -0.0593, -0.0334, 0.02, -0.0371, -0.0441, 0.0407, -0.0805, 0.0058, 0.1039, 0.0534, 0.0495, -0.0325, 0.0782, -0.0403, 0.0108, -0.0068, -0.0525, 0.0801, 0.0256, -0.0183, -0.0619, -0.0063, -0.0605, 0.0377, -0.0281, -0.0097, -0.0029, -0.106, 0.0465, -0.0033, -0.0308, 0.0357, 0.0156, -0.0406, -0.0308, 0.0013, 0.0458, 0.0231, 0.0207, -0.0828, -0.0573, 0.0298, -0.0381, 0.0935, -0.0498, -0.0979, -0.1452, 0.0835, -0.0973, -0.0172, 0.0003, 0.09, -0.0931, -0.0252, 0.008, -0.0441, -0.0938, -0.0021, 0.0885, 0.0088, 0.0034, -0.0049, 0.0217, 0.0584, -0.012, 0.059, 0.0146, -0.0, -0.0045, 0.0663, 0.0017, 0.0015, 0.0569, -0.0089, -0.0232, 0.0065, 0.0204, -0.0253, 0.1119, -0.036, 0.0125, 0.0531, 0.0584, -0.0101, -0.0593, -0.0577, -0.0656, -0.0396, 0.0525, -0.006, -0.0149, 0.003, -0.1009, -0.0281, 0.0311, -0.0088, 0.0441, -0.0056, 0.0715, 0.051, 0.0219, -0.0028, 0.0294, -0.0969, -0.0852, 0.0304, 0.0374, 0.1078, -0.0559, 0.0805, -0.0464, 0.0369, 0.0874, -0.0251, 0.0075, -0.0502, -0.0181, -0.1059, 0.0111, 0.0894, 0.0021, 0.0838, 0.0497, -0.0183, 0.0246, -0.004, -0.0828, 0.06, -0.1161, -0.0367, 0.0475, 0.0317]) AS distance
